## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Aninda, and I'm a Biostatistics Ph.D. candidate at the Medical College of Wisconsin, interested in developing statistical methodologies that can be applied to improve public health.
 
 ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on network modeling for my dissertation and collaborating with pediatric hematologists and epidemiologists to optimize treatment protocols by
     analyzing Electronic Health Record (EHR) data.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently developing a Bayesian hierarchical modeling structure to flexibly relate brain networks to individual traits, leveraging Metropolis-Hastings and Gibbs-sampling simulation.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I can make some mostly accurate animal sounds...:D
